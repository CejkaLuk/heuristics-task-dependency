Welcome to HMADP's documentation!
=================================

HMADP is short for *Heuristic Methods for Activity Dependency Problems*.
This project contains the implementation of a select few heuristic methods
that attempt to solve activity dependency problems.

In the context of this project *Task Dependency Problems* are, for example,
problems that are analyzed using the `Critical Path Method (CPM) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method>`_.
Additionally, the problems are limited by the resources available at one point in time.
Complete information on the problems and methods that can be used to solve them is found in [Fiala2008]_
